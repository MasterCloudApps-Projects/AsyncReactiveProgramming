== 💁‍♀️ Useful information

=== 🚀 How to launch the project?

The project is designed to be executed from your integrated development environment.

=== 🏹 HTTP Endpoints

CAUTION: IntelliJ Http Client does not manage Server Sent Events really well, use other client like Chrome or https://httpie.io/[*HTTPie*] instead

Both projects are thought to be executed from the IDE to carry out the necessary tests. An HTTP file with the API calls that can be executed from IntelliJ Idea is included in each one (*characters-api.http* and *animals-api.http*).

=== 🧪 Integration tests

In addition, the project contains integration tests with https://rest-assured.io/[*RestAssured*] and *WebTestClient* that performs the calls:
