== ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

The example has two modules: *Module one acts as the server. Module two acts as a client*

The project contains code to test the different information flows that RSocket allows:

- fire-and-forget
- request-response
- request-stream
- channel

The API sends and receives simple messages that carry an author and a message.

=== üöÄ How to launch the project?

The project is designed to be executed from our favorite IDE. Module 1 must be started first and then module 2, which is the one that acts as *requester*.

Later in the console of each of the services we can see the messages and their responses preceded by a number from 1 to 4 that indicates each of the flows.

Some examples of responses by flow (*random* content):
