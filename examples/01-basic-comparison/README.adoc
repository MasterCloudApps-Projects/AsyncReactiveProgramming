=== 🚀 How to launch the project?

The project is designed to be executed from your integrated development environment.

=== 🏹 HTTP Endpoints

Both projects are thought to be executed from the IDE to carry out the necessary tests. An HTTP file with the API calls that can be executed from IntelliJ Idea is included in each one (*users-api.http*).
