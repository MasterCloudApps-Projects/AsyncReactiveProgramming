== üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Useful information

=== üí° IntelliJ Idea

The examples have been made with the help of the *IntelliJ Idea IDE*.

IntelliJ Idea is the most famous integrated development environment for Java and you can find it in two versions, a community version and a commercial version:

* https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA (by Jetbrains)]

This software is likely to be referenced at some point in the documentation or resources for the examples.

=== ‚òï Java 15+... Download & manage

The code is based on *Java 15* and uses preview features such as *Records*. If you want to know the evolution of Java features from 8 to 15+, please check the *Guides* section.

If you want to download a version of Java and you don't know where:

* https://adoptopenjdk.net/[AdoptOpenJDK - Prebuilt OpenJDK Binaries for Free!]

A HIGHLY recommended tool for downloading and managing multiple JDKs is *SDKMan*. You can consult more information in the *Guides* section.


=== ‚òï Java 15+... Maven & Gradle

To setup this behaviour the *Maven* POMs contain *<argLine>--enable-preview</argLine>*:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<build>
    <plugins>

        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        </plugin>

        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
            <configuration>
                <source>15</source>
                <target>15</target>
                <compilerArgs>--enable-preview</compilerArgs>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>

        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
            <configuration>
                <argLine>--enable-preview</argLine>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>

    </plugins>
</build>
----

With Gradle you can add this:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
tasks.withType(JavaCompile).all {
    options.compilerArgs += ['--enable-preview']
}

tasks.withType(Test).all {
    jvmArgs += '--enable-preview'
}

tasks.withType(JavaExec) {
    jvmArgs += '--enable-preview'
}
----

=== üí° HTTP Client

Most examples have an API to query. For this, in each project that requires it, a file with the definition of the API has been incorporated to be executed in the HTTP client of IntelliJ IDEA.

Also some examples include screenshots of a console HTTP client called *HTTPie*.

=== üìñ Public APIS

During the development of the examples, we have always tried to use public APIs to create more realistic workflows.

A good collection of public APIs can be found in the *public-apis/public-apis* repository. The link can be found in the *Guides* section.

=== ü§° Java Faker

In certain examples, the *JavaFaker* library has been used to generate test data of different types.

Links to its repository as well as a short summary of its functionalities are available in the *Guides* section.
