=== ☕ Project Loom

First and foremost: What is *Project Loom*?

According to https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/loom/Main[OpenJDK Wiki]:

====
Project Loom is to intended to explore, incubate and deliver Java VM features and APIs built on top of them for the purpose of supporting easy-to-use, high-throughput lightweight concurrency and new programming models on the Java platform. This is accomplished by the addition of the following constructs:

- Virtual threads
- Delimited continuations
- Tail-call elimination
